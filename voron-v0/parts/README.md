## Bed Handle

for the common 120mm magnetic bed with the tab, this gives a grip to pull out
the bed without burning your fingers on the heated bed. It has stops to keep
your fingers from touching the hot aluminum/heat pad and helps registering
the correct position when putting the magnetic bed back on.

use self tapping m2x10 screws to attach to pad. Do not overtighten or you
can warp the bed.
